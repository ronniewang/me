= basic approach
:nofooter:


Through this time and until now I followed the same basic approach I used as a 12-year-old caddie trying to beat the market, i.e., by

1) working for what I wanted, not for what others wanted me to do;

2) coming up withthe best independent opinions I could muster to move toward my goals;

3) stress-testing my opinions by having the smartest people I could find challenge them so I could find out where I was wrong;

4) being wary about overconfidence, and good at not knowing; and

5) wrestling with reality, experiencing the results of my decisions, and reflecting on what I did to produce them so that I could improve.
